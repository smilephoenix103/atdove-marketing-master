# Purpose
This is a Wordpress marketing website for At Dove (https://www.atdove.org/).

This is a WordPress repository configured to run on the [Pantheon platform](https://pantheon.io). 

# Codebase
Even though the site is hosted on Pantheon, we have a fork of the Pantheon repo on GitHub (which you're looking at now).
Clone this instead of the Pantheon repo, however both should work. https://https://github.com/HelloWorldDevs/atdove-marketing

Pantheon has it's own Git repo. You can get a link to clone it here: https://dashboard.pantheon.io/sites/3b814c56-250e-4574-9447-7c94207c3bda#dev/code

# Pantheon
